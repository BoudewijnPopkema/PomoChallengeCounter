Always reference the /docs folder when working on this project. Key documents include:

- architecture.md: System design, patterns, and component relationships
- technical-specifications.md: Detailed implementation specs and requirements
- workflow.md: Development processes and operational procedures
- features.md: Feature descriptions and business logic
- requirements.md: Core project requirements and constraints
- commands.md: Discord bot command specifications
- database-schema.md: Data model and schema definitions
- configuration.md: Setup and configuration details

Before implementing changes:
1. Review relevant documentation to understand current design
2. Check if proposed changes align with documented architecture
3. Consider impact on related components described in docs

After implementing changes that differ from documentation:
1. Update affected documentation files to reflect new reality
2. Ensure consistency across related docs
3. Update technical specs if core functionality changes
4. Maintain alignment between code and documented behavior

The documentation serves as the source of truth for intended behavior - keep it current and accurate.
